About
A pcap based packet sniffer made for IPK course summer 2021 at FIT VUT.
This project is about 90% complete, lacking output formatting, other parts should work as intended.

Compilation:
    $make compile
or
    $make

Running:
    $./ipk-sniffer [-i rozhraní | --interface rozhraní] {-p ­­port} {[--tcp|-t] [--udp|-u] [--arp] [--icmp] } {-n num}
where:
    -i interface to sniff on, if left blank will print all available devices
    -p port to sniff on
    -t only sniff TCP traffic
    -u only sniff UDP traffic
    --arp only sniff ARP traffic
    --icmp only sniff ICMP traffic
        If multiple protocols are specified the filter applies a logical OR operation.
    -n number of packets to print, default 0, value of -1 will sniff until manually closed such as witch Control + C

Supported link-layer types:
